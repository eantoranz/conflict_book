\section{Conventions}

I will be using code from different sources. Some will be made-up (and therefore, no guarantees that the code makes sense....
or even works) and some will come from real projects.

I will be using git as the version control system for the examples. Version 2.26.2 from debian testing packages as of the
moment I am writing this line. \footnote{Some examples are currently written in previous versions and the output might not
be consistent for the same operations. That is because operations like rebase are getting a major overhaul in git. Sorry for
any inconvenience this might produce.}

When showing content of files, there will be the number of each line on the left. When running commands and showing output, there
will be no numbering of the lines, unless stated otherwise.

When running commands, you will see the usual \$ that is normally shown on prompts \footnote{Different people might have other
things set up on their prompt.} followed by the command that I am running. On some occasions I might be showing the output of more
than one command. On those cases, what I run each time will be prepended by the prompt \$.

Do not expect to see many screenshots in the book. It is a mostly-text book. When I analyze the conflicts, they are shown in plain
text, I won't be using any IDE to help me solve the conflicts.
