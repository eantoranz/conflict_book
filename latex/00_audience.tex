\section{Intended Audience}

This book is intended for developers of all levels, be it master developers or novices. I would expect novice developers to be able to take advantage of the most of it. Developers who have already been in the trenches working on difficult merging processes and are already so adapt at it that they even volunteer to solve conflicts for others will probably know most of it already, though I wouldn't be surprised if even they learn a few tricks while going through this manual.
