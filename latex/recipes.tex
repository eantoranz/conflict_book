\section{Correct EOL-format history change}
\label{correct_eol_history}

As part of the files that make up this book, there must be a script called {\bf correct\_eol.sh}. This script assumes
you need to correct the {\bf EOL-format} of a set of files on a straight branch, in other words, a branch that has no merges, only revisions
one after the other.

When calling the script you need to provide:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the last revision where the format of the files is {\bf correct}
	\item the branch or tip revision whose history we need to correct
	\item the list of files that has to be adjusted
\end{itemize}

The script will basically rewrite history of the branch (starting on the last revision with the correct {\bf EOL-format})
making sure to use the original {\bf EOL-format} on each one of the files that were provided as arguments on each one of
the subsequent revisions.
